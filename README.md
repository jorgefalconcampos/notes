# mvn-front

Back to April 2020 I've created this little project in my spare time. I wanted to integrate VueJS + Mongo + Express - tbh I do not remember which tutorial I saw, and actually this was not versioned and the project in my old laptop didn't have a single commit, so... I decided to upload it a year later ðŸ˜…

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
